# Reverse Playlist Order for YouTube

To use it you will need a userscript manager, like Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey.

Creates a button on your playlists which allows you to reverse the order of the videos.
Based on the Standalone YouTube Plus Reverse Playlist that is now dead.

I created 1.0.3a as 1.0.3 has stopped working on Firefox and is no longer supported by the creator.
