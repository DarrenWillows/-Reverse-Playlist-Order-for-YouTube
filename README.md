# -Reverse-Playlist-Order-for-YouTube

Creates a button on your playlists which allows you to reverse the order of the videos.
Based on the Standalone YouTube Plus Reverse Playlist that is now dead.

I created 1.0.3a as 1.0.3 has stopped working on Firefox and is no longer supported by the creator.
